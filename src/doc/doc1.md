title: Exposure
---
Exposure in photography refers to the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor when taking a photograph. It is determined by three main factors: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. Aperture refers to the size of the lens opening, which controls how much light enters the camera.

Shutter speed dictates how long the sensor is exposed to light, while ISO measures the sensor's sensitivity to light. Balancing these three elements is crucial in achieving proper exposure, which ensures that the image is neither too bright (overexposed) nor too dark (underexposed). Mastering exposure is essential for capturing well-lit and visually pleasing photographs.
