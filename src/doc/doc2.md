title: Aperture
---
In photography, aperture refers to the opening in a camera lens that controls the amount of light that passes through to the camera's sensor. It is measured in f-stops, with a larger aperture (smaller f-stop number) allowing more light to enter, resulting in a shallower depth of field and a blurred background.

Conversely, a smaller aperture (larger f-stop number) lets in less light, resulting in a larger depth of field where more of the image is in focus. Understanding how to manipulate aperture settings can significantly impact the aesthetic and technical aspects of a photograph.
