title: Shutter speed
---
Shutter speed in photography refers to the amount of time the camera's shutter remains open to allow light to reach the camera's sensor. It is measured in fractions of a second, ranging from very fast shutter speeds (1/1000s) to slower speeds (1/30s or longer).

Faster shutter speeds freeze motion, making them ideal for capturing fast moving subjects without blur, while slower shutter speeds allow for longer exposures, creating effects like motion blur or smooth water. Understanding and controlling shutter speed is essential in photography to achieve the desired level of sharpness and motion in an image.
