title: ISO sensitivity
---
ISO in photography refers to the sensitivity of the camera sensor to light. A higher ISO allows for better performance in low light conditions but can result in more digital noise in the image. Conversely, a lower ISO produces cleaner images but requires more light.

Understanding how to adjust ISO settings can greatly impact the quality of your photographs by controlling the balance between brightness, noise, and sharpness. It is an essential aspect of photography that should be mastered to achieve desired results in various shooting conditions. By utilizing the appropriate ISO setting, photographers can enhance the overall quality and aesthetic appeal of their images.
